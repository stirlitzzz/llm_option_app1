Great. Here’s a high-level reasoning loop that sits above your PDE/QL stack and actually influences trading, not just plumbing:

#1 Sense
	•	Ingest surfaces, flows (OI, gamma), events (earnings, macro), and a few text streams (sell-side blurbs, company headlines).
	•	Goal: a situational snapshot (regime tags like “short-gamma”, “event-risk”, “carry-dominant”).

#2 Hypothesize
	•	Generate a few causal stories consistent with the snapshot (e.g., “borrow squeeze into low float,” “pre-CPI vol hoarding”).
	•	Attach testable implications: skew should steepen; combo should drift X bps; term carry should invert beyond 3M, etc.

#3 Choose the engine (meta-model selection)
	•	Pick which deterministic module to trust right now (e.g., American PDE with dividend jumps vs. Euro parity with microstructure filters).
	•	Set calibration knobs: carry source (combo-implied vs curve), dividend treatment (cash vs yield), smile parametrization.

#4 Calibrate with intent
	•	Fit only what the current hypothesis says matters (e.g., per-expiry carry from ATM combos; local skew around moneyness band you’ll trade).
	•	Sanity-check: reject trades if required calibration violates basic economics (negative PV(divs) or absurd borrow).

#5 Propose trades (reasoned synthesis)
	•	Map edge → structure: if edge is in carry term, prefer calendars; if it’s skew, prefer verticals or risk reversals.
	•	Constrain by risk story (Δ/Γ/vega/Θ) and event map (ex-div, earnings, macro date proximity).

#6 Explain & prioritize
	•	For each candidate: one-line thesis (“Edge = borrow misfit +42 bps; early-exercise adds 6¢; crowded short puts risk”).
	•	Rank by robustness: how many hypotheses agree? how sensitive to small knob changes?

#7 Monitor & adapt
	•	Track leading indicators tied to the thesis (combo drift, borrow shift, skew slope).
	•	If indicators break the story, switch engines/assumptions or flatten—fast.

#8 Learn
	•	After action, write the post-mortem: which causal link held, which didn’t.
	•	Update a tiny playbook: “When pre-event gamma is negative and borrow rising, prioritize put calendars over outright.”

In short: the LLM’s job is which story, which model, which knob, which structure, right now—and to change its mind quickly when the world flips. Your deterministic code still does the numbers; the reasoning layer decides the game.
